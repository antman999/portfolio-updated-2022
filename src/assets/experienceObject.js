      "▹ Shipped a complete redesign of our headers. The point of this project was to reduce visual excess on our header and make a more pleasant customer experience. This can be seen on every single header on twitter.com there is a blur animation as the user scrolls. \n\n▹ Helped ship automation of documenting props and types, this is similar to react-docgen but we have built our internal one to automate prop documentation and make it easier for all developers using our component library to document changes.  \n\n▹ Upgrade our entire web repo and customers code base from RNW .16 to RNW .18 and address all breaking changes.",
